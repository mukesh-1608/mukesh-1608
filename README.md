## 🚀 About Me
I’m a **Computer Science (Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics)** student at **VIT Bhopal** with hands-on experience in **Cloud, DevOps, Security, and Blockchain**.  
I don’t just learn tools — I build **real-world projects** with them. From tokenizing livestock assets on BlockDAG to creating autonomous drones and deploying production-ready apps with CI/CD, I thrive where code meets scale.  

💡 I believe in solving **practical problems with technology** and pushing boundaries in **Cloud + Security + Blockchain**.
